                    <h3>Decision Making</h3>
                    <p>Chess is a game of constant decision making. Improving your game demands strategic and well thought out evaluation of changing positions, as well as your moves and the opponent's. Having to make decisions while considering different perspectives and ideas consistently will build a stronger habit of decision making.</p>
                
                </div>
                
                <div class="one-of-three">
                <i class="far fa-lightbulb"></i>
                    <h3>Creativity and Focus</h3>
                    <p>A well played game demands focus from the players, as well as inspiration in new and untested positions. Getting into the habit of thinking outside of the box, against natural conventions and instinct can also open one's thought in everyday life.</p>
                
                </div>

                    <h3>Perspective</h3>
                    <p>It's not just about thinking from your opponents point of view. Part of developing one's chess game is also gaining input from other players, and studying the games of world champions and masters, to see what thought process, playing style, and ideas brought them to their high level. </p>
